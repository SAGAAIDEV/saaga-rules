# Guideline: Defining Technical Requirements

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the standard process for defining, documenting, and validating Technical Requirements for a system, subsystem, or feature. The resulting Technical Requirements Document (TRD) serves as a detailed specification for development and testing, ensuring alignment with the project vision, user stories, and architectural decisions.

## 2. Inputs and Prerequisites

Before initiating TRD development, ensure the following artifacts are available and reviewed:

*   **Project Vision Statement:** (`docs/<feature_name>/01_vision.md`) - Provides overall goals and context.
*   **User Stories / Functional Requirements:** (`docs/<feature_name>/05_user_stories.md` or equivalent) - Defines user-facing needs.
*   **System Architecture Document:** (`docs/<feature_name>/04_system_architecture.md`) - Outlines the technical structure.
*   **Technology Stack Document:** (`docs/<feature_name>/03_technology_stack.md`) - Specifies chosen technologies and versions.

## 3. The TRD Development Process

Developing the TRD is a collaborative effort involving Product Owners, Architects, Developers, and Testers.

### 3.1. Requirement Elicitation and Refinement

*   **Review Inputs:** Analyze the prerequisite documents to identify technical implications and necessary details.
*   **Collaborative Workshops:** Conduct sessions with stakeholders to:
    *   Break down user stories into detailed technical steps.
    *   Define specific data structures, algorithms, and interactions.
    *   Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.).
    *   Clarify interface specifications (APIs, data formats).
*   **Critical Analysis:** Challenge requirements for clarity, testability, feasibility, and necessity. Ensure requirements focus on *what* is needed technically, not *how* it will be implemented (unless the *how* is a specific constraint).
*   **Prioritization:** If necessary, collaborate with the Product Owner to prioritize technical requirements based on value and dependency.

### 3.2. Documenting Requirements

*   **Use Standard Structure:** Organize the TRD using a consistent structure (see Section 4).
*   **Assign Unique IDs:** Assign a unique, trackable ID to each requirement (e.g., TR-FR-001, TR-NFR-015). Use a consistent naming convention.
*   **Write SMART Requirements:** Ensure each requirement is:
    *   **S**pecific: Clear and unambiguous.
    *   **M**easurable: Quantifiable and testable.
    *   **A**chievable: Feasible within project constraints.
    *   **R**elevant: Directly supports user stories or architectural needs.
    *   **T**ime-bound: (Implicitly within the project timeline, explicitly if needed).
*   **Detail Inputs, Processing, Outputs:** For functional requirements, specify expected inputs, processing logic/rules, and outputs.
*   **Define Error Handling:** Specify how errors should be handled and reported.
*   **Quantify Non-Functional Requirements:** Use specific metrics (e.g., "API response time < 500ms under X load," "Data encryption using AES-256").
*   **Specify Interfaces:** Detail API endpoints, request/response formats (e.g., JSON schemas), protocols, and authentication methods.
*   **Define Data:** Specify data models, schemas, types, validation rules, and persistence mechanisms.
*   **Security Considerations:** Detail authentication, authorization, data privacy, and vulnerability mitigation requirements.
*   **Rationale:** Briefly explain the reasoning behind complex or critical requirements.
*   **Glossary:** Maintain a glossary for technical terms and acronyms.

### 3.3. Review and Validation

*   **Peer Review:** Conduct technical reviews with developers and architects to ensure accuracy and feasibility.
*   **Stakeholder Review:** Review with Product Owners and Testers to ensure alignment with functional needs and testability.
*   **Traceability Check:** Ensure each technical requirement traces back to a user story, architectural component, or non-functional goal.
*   **Iteration:** Refine the TRD based on feedback until consensus is reached.
*   **Formal Approval:** Obtain sign-off from key stakeholders (e.g., Tech Lead, Product Owner).
