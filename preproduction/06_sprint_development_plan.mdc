# Instructions for Creating a Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

These instructions guide you in writing a comprehensive and effective Technical Requirements Document.

## 1. Preparation and Planning

*   **Understand the Scope:** Define the exact system, subsystem, or component the TRD will cover. This scope determines the breadth and depth of the requirements.
*   **Review Existing Documentation:** Thoroughly review the Vision Document, Software Requirements Specification (SRS), System Design Document (SDD), User Stories, and any other related documents. This provides context and ensures alignment.
*   **Identify Stakeholders:** Determine who will use the TRD (developers, testers, project managers, clients). Tailor the language and level of detail to their needs.
*   **Choose Tools:** Select tools for writing, managing, and versioning the TRD (e.g., Markdown editor, Confluence, Google Docs, Git).
*   **Establish Naming Conventions:** Define clear and consistent naming conventions for requirements (e.g., FR-001, NFR-001, IR-001) and data elements.
*   **Define a Glossary:** Create a glossary of terms to ensure consistent understanding of technical jargon and acronyms.

## 2. Gathering Requirements

*   **Elicit Requirements from Stakeholders:** Conduct interviews, workshops, or surveys to gather requirements from all relevant stakeholders.
*   **Analyze Existing Systems:** If the system is replacing or integrating with an existing system, analyze that system to identify relevant requirements.
*   **Consider Different Perspectives:** Explore requirements from different perspectives, such as user needs, business goals, security concerns, and technical constraints.
*   **Focus on Specificity:** Drill down to precise details. Avoid vague statements like "The system should be fast." Instead, aim for "The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds."
*   **Use Templates and Checklists:** Leverage templates and checklists to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant requirement categories (functional, non-functional, interface, data, security).

## 3. Writing the TRD

*   **Follow the TRD Structure:** Adhere to the standard TRD structure outlined below (or adapt it to your specific project needs):

    *   **1. Introduction:**
        *   Purpose of the document
        *   Scope of the system/component
        *   References to related documents
    *   **2. Functional Requirements:**
        *   Detailed descriptions of what the system *must do*.
        *   Input data, processing logic, output data, error handling.
        *   Dependencies on other requirements or systems.
    *   **3. Non-Functional Requirements:**
        *   Detailed descriptions of *how well* the system must perform.
        *   Performance, security, usability, reliability, scalability, maintainability.
        *   Measurable metrics and target values.
    *   **4. Interface Requirements:**
        *   Detailed descriptions of how the system interacts with other systems, hardware, or users.
        *   Data formats, protocols, API specifications, error handling.
    *   **5. Data Requirements:**
        *   Data structures, data types, data validation rules.
        *   Database schema, tables, relationships, constraints.
    *   **6. Security Requirements:**
        *   Authentication, authorization, data protection, vulnerability management.
        *   Security standards and best practices.
    *   **7. Hardware Requirements (If Applicable):**
        *   Minimum and recommended hardware specifications.
        *   CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth.
    *   **8. Software Requirements:**
        *   Operating systems, libraries, frameworks.
        *   Version numbers and dependencies.
    *   **9. Assumptions and Constraints:**
        *   Explicitly state any assumptions made during requirements gathering.
        *   Document any constraints on the design or implementation.
    *   **10. Glossary:**
        *   Define technical terms, acronyms, and project-specific vocabulary.

*   **Write Clear and Concise Requirements:**
    *   Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon or explain it clearly.
    *   Use active voice and strong verbs.
    *   Each requirement should be a single, complete sentence.
    *   Avoid ambiguity. Be specific and precise.

*   **Make Requirements Measurable:**
    *   Define metrics that can be used to verify that the requirement has been met.
    *   Use quantitative measures whenever possible (e.g., response time in seconds, transactions per second, memory usage in megabytes).

*   **Provide Rationale for Each Requirement:**
    *   Explain why the requirement is important and how it contributes to the project's goals.
    *   This helps stakeholders understand the context and priorities.

*   **Example of a well-written requirement:**

    ```
    * **FR-001: User Authentication**
        * **Description:** The system shall authenticate users using email address and password credentials.
        * **Input Data:** Email address (validated format), password (minimum 8 characters, requiring one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number).
        * **Processing Logic:** Verify email exists, hash password and compare with stored hash, create session if successful.
        * **Output Data:** Success message or error message.
        * **Error Handling:** Display error messages for invalid email/password combination, account locked due to multiple failed attempts, etc.
        * **Rationale:** This ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
    ```

## 4. Reviewing and Validating the TRD

*   **Review with Stakeholders:** Share the TRD with all relevant stakeholders for review and feedback.
*   **Address Comments and Concerns:** Carefully consider all feedback and revise the TRD accordingly.
*   **Verify Traceability:** Ensure that all requirements can be traced back to the Vision Document, SRS, or other relevant documents.
*   **Conduct Walkthroughs:** Conduct walkthroughs with developers and testers to ensure they understand the requirements and their implications.
*   **Get Sign-Off:** Obtain formal sign-off from key stakeholders to indicate their approval of the TRD.

## 5. Maintaining the TRD

*   **Use Version Control:** Store the TRD in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
*   **Update the TRD as the System Evolves:** Keep the TRD up-to-date as the system evolves and requirements change.
*   **Communicate Changes:** Communicate any changes to the TRD to all stakeholders.
*   **Establish a Change Management Process:** Implement a formal change management process to ensure that changes to the TRD are properly reviewed and approved.
*   **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews of the TRD to ensure it remains accurate and complete.

## 6. Saving a new TRD

*   Save in ./docs/preproduction/02_technical_requirements.md

## Key Considerations

*   **Prioritize Requirements:** If possible, prioritize requirements based on their importance to the project's success. This helps guide development efforts and manage scope.
*   **Document Assumptions:** Explicitly document any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process.
*   **Document Constraints:** Clearly state any constraints on the design or implementation of the system (e.g., budget limitations, technology restrictions, regulatory compliance requirements).
*   **Focus on Testability:** Write requirements in a way that makes them testable. For non-functional requirements, specify clear metrics and target values.
*   **Remember the Audience:** Write the TRD with the intended audience in mind. Use clear and concise language, and avoid jargon that may not be understood by all stakeholders.

By following these instructions, you can create a Technical Requirements Document that is clear, accurate, complete, and concise, and that effectively guides the development of your software system.
