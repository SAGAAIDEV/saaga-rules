# 03: Technical Stack

This document outlines the core technologies and architectural approaches used in the MCP Server Configuration Program.

## Core Technologies

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the backend logic, component development, and overall application structure.
*   **Streamlit:** Used for building the user-friendly web interface, allowing for rapid development and interactive components.
*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** The target protocol for configuration. The program is designed to manage and generate configurations for various MCP server instances that implement the Model Context Protocol specification.

## Architectural Approach for MCP Servers

*   **Modularity:** Each MCP server type (e.g., JIRA, GitHub, AWS) is developed as a distinct and independent component.
*   **Submodules:** These components can be thought of as submodules within the larger application, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
*   **Isolated Environments (Conceptual):** While not strictly separate runtime environments for each server *within this configuration program*, the design emphasizes that each MCP server component manages its own specific configuration parameters and logic. This mirrors the idea that each underlying MCP server often operates in its own distinct environment or requires unique credentials. The configuration program centralizes the setup for these diverse server types.
