# Technical Specification: MCP Server Configuration Program

## 1. Introduction

This document details the technical specifications and requirements for the MCP Server Configuration Program, building upon the vision outlined in `01_vision_statement.md`. The program aims to provide a user-friendly interface for configuring various MCP server instances, managing their associated workflows, and generating their respective `MCP.json` files.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1. User Interface (UI)

*   **Technology:** The program will utilize a lightweight and easy-to-use UI framework. Streamlit is the primary candidate due to its rapid development capabilities and Python integration. Alternatives will be considered if Streamlit proves unsuitable for specific requirements.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Intuitive forms for inputting server details, credentials, and other configuration parameters.
    *   Clear feedback mechanisms for successful configurations or errors.
    *   Ability to manage configurations for multiple MCP server types.

### 2.2. MCP Server Components

*   **Modularity:** Each MCP server type (e.g., JIRA, GitHub, AWS, etc.) will be represented as a distinct component or module within a dedicated Python package (e.g., `mcp_servers`).
*   **Structure:** Each server component will encapsulate the logic for:
    *   Defining the required configuration parameters (e.g., API tokens, URLs, usernames).
    *   Validating the user-provided inputs for that specific server type.
    *   Generating the corresponding section of the `MCP.json` file.
*   **Discoverability:** The program will be able to discover and list available MCP server components dynamically from this package.
*   **Interoperability:** While distinct, these components will be designed to work harmoniously within the larger configuration program, allowing users to configure multiple services that might interact or share common organizational settings.

### 2.3. `MCP.json` File Generation

*   **Location:** The generated `MCP.json` file will be created in a user-specified location, or a sensible default path if not specified. The program should provide flexibility in determining the output directory.
*   **Content:** The file will be a valid JSON object containing all the configurations for the selected and configured MCP servers.
*   **Updates:** The program should be able to update existing `MCP.json` files or create new ones.

## 3. Technical Requirements

*   **Programming Language:** Python (version 3.8+ recommended).
*   **UI Framework:** Streamlit (or an equivalent easy-to-use framework).
*   **Configuration Storage (Internal):** Secure storage for sensitive information like tokens and passwords will be a priority. Initially, this might involve environment variables or a local, encrypted configuration file. For more robust solutions, integration with secrets management systems (as mentioned in future considerations of the vision statement) will be explored.
*   **Packaging:** The MCP server components will be organized within a dedicated Python package (e.g., `src/mcp_server_configs/servers` or `src/saaga_rules/mcp_servers`).
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for easy addition of new MCP server types without significant modifications to the core program.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and clear user messaging for invalid inputs or configuration issues.

## 4. Data Flow (Simplified)

1.  User launches the program (e.g., `streamlit run app.py`).
2.  UI presents options to select and configure MCP server types.
3.  User inputs credentials and parameters for chosen servers.
4.  Program validates inputs using the respective server component logic.
5.  Upon successful validation, the program compiles the configurations.
6.  Program generates/updates the `MCP.json` file in the specified location.

## 5. Key Assumptions

*   Users will have the necessary permissions to write files to their chosen output directory.
*   The structure of the `MCP.json` file is well-defined and understood for each MCP server type.

## 6. Future Considerations

*   **Schema Validation:** Implement schema validation for `MCP.json` to ensure correctness.
*   **Plugin System:** Develop a more formal plugin system for adding new MCP server types.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all components.
