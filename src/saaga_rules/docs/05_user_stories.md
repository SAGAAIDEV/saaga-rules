# 05: User Stories

This document outlines the key user stories for the MCP Server Configuration Program.

## Core User Stories

1.  **Launch and Access:** As a user, I want to launch a command that opens a Streamlit web interface so that I can easily access the configuration program.
2.  **Manual Configuration Input:** As a user, I want to be able to input all necessary configurations manually through the interface, especially until more automated methods are implemented, so that I can set up my MCP servers.
3.  **Categorized Server Selection:** As a user, I want to select MCP servers from a categorized list (e.g., by function, vendor) so that I can quickly find and choose the servers I need to configure.
4.  **Project Location Specification:** As a user, I want to choose the specific project location (directory) where the MCP server configurations (`MCP.json`) will be generated so that the files are organized according to my project structure.
5.  **JSON File Generation/Update:** As a user, I want to generate or update `MCP.json` files with the ability to either:
    *   Append new configurations to an existing `MCP.json` file.
    *   Overwrite an existing `MCP.json` file with the new configurations.
    So that I have flexible control over how my configuration files are managed.
