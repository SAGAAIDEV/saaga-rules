**Title:** Initialize MCP Server with Bluesky Integration Capabilities  

| **Story Type:** Technical/Enabler |
**Epic/Feature:** Bluesky Social Media MCP Server
| **Status:** Draft |

**Story Description:**

As an MCP client application or AI agent,
I need the Bluesky MCP server to initialize with proper protocol compliance and tool registration,
So that I can discover and utilize Bluesky social media capabilities through standardized MCP interfaces.

**Business Context:**

The MCP server must establish proper protocol communication and advertise its available tools according to MCP specification standards. This foundational story enables all subsequent Bluesky functionality by ensuring the server can be discovered and integrated into AI agent workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**AC1 - MCP Protocol Initialization:**
Given the Bluesky MCP server is started,
When an MCP client connects to the server,
Then the server responds with proper MCP protocol handshake including server capabilities and available tools.

**AC2 - Tool Registration and Discovery:**
Given the MCP server has initialized successfully,
When an MCP client requests available tools,
Then the server returns a complete list of Bluesky tools including: `bluesky_post_text`, `bluesky_post_image`, `bluesky_post_video`, `bluesky_reply`, `bluesky_get_replies`, `bluesky_search_hashtags`, `bluesky_get_feed`, `bluesky_get_notifications`.

**AC3 - Server Health and Readiness:**
Given the MCP server is running,
When a health check is performed,
Then the server responds with status "ready" and confirms Bluesky API connectivity is available.

**AC4 - Error Handling and Graceful Degradation:**
Given the MCP server encounters initialization errors,
When critical components fail to load,
Then the server logs detailed error information and exits gracefully with appropriate error codes.

**Definition of Done Checklist:**

Given I have a configuration file,
When I run account management commands,
Then I can execute:
- `mcp-bluesky status` - Check connection status for all accounts
- `mcp-bluesky auth --account personal` - Re-authenticate specific account
- `mcp-bluesky list-accounts` - List all configured accounts

**AC6 - Configuration Display and Management:**
Given I have a configuration file,
When I run `mcp-bluesky config show`,
Then I can view the current configuration with sensitive credentials masked and see which sites are configured.

**AC7 - Configuration Cleanup Operations:**
Given I want to clean up configuration-related files,
When I run configuration cleanup commands,
Then I can execute:
